## Cyberdeck - secure standalone PC



The intent is to design a secure, portable stand alone computer to be used for ITNOBAN. This will show the user exactly what is going on and to assist with environmental awareness.

The initial design is a cyberdeck because they look cool, and it will need a lot of hardware testing, config and tweaking to work out what is useful.

The final 'end user' design will be a lot simpler (interface wise), infact it probably wont have (or shouldn't have) a lot of knobs and dials to configure things - it will likely be a voice activated / menu driven / event driven thing that quietly assists the user.

But, for now - we are going to make it will lots of bells and whistles!
