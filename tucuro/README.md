# Tucuro - Self managed Game Data
An experiment to see if game data can be transferred across different platforms.

Tucuro is derived from latin

tu = You

curo = manage

## How it (could) work
Basically you store your data on your own platform, via an encrypted file of some sort.

When you sign up for an online game you share the data you want and they take that to build your character (eg, your preferred name, appearance, style of cloths)

The gaming platform has the option to also take into account the skills of your character (such as mining, fighting with AK47, or fishing)

As you play on the gaming platform, the achievements, and stats and new skills earned are sent back to your platform so you keep them [if / when the site goes off line]
