It will be a system that provides guidence to people with cognitive disabilities 

#### Requirement #1 - be secure so you trust it

The software needs to be completely secure so that you trust it.

This needs to happen over a long period of time, ideally 10+ years of you using it - and you need to keep using it

#### Requirement #2 - stay the same

The software is going to help you as you progress into old age with lessened cognitive abilities, so you will not want a new interface each year - the look / sound / feel must stay the same.

There are 2 reasons for this:
1. Old people generally dont like change, especially software changes with things moved around.
2. Fading memory. In a lot of cases, memory loss is for more recent events, but if you have used your software for 20 years there is a better chance that you will recognise it and trust its output

#### Requirement #3 - take into account your wishes
you need to specify what conditions you would want to know when it is time to take action, such as move into a retirement home / hospital


#### Requirement #4 - tell you what is going on

this is going to be quite a difficult thing to do. It isn't just a feed of your favourite tweets and events but the software needs to be able to TELL you how you are actually going. eg
- "Your mental faculties are ok - 8/10 things remembered"
- "You forget to take your pills 7 times out of 10"
- "You usually forget to turn the oven off"
