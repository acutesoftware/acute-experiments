## Scenarios for ITNOBAM

Examples of some of the scenarios that could be considered


### Simple Scenarios

#### Where are my keys?

Tracking previous user locations, it can suggest places in the house / map 
where you were previously that the keys may be.

#### Why did I come into this room?

Ever walk into a room and forgot why you went in there?  Pretty normal, and 
usually not an issue, but this could help.

Use voice playback of what you just said before might assist this


### Complex Scenarios


#### When to trust your Doctor

The user has a cognitive disorder that will get worse over time.

The system should give the best advice to the user for the users benefit.
The user has previously instructed but taking into consideration the cognitive condition.

 > User wants to continue living at home
 > Doctor agrees, but over time condition gets worse. 

How / when should the system tell the user that they should listen to the 
Doctor and go.

#### When to trust your carers

User trusts most carers, and all is good. 

Is there a check for carers with a financial interest in the user (ie family 
home could be sold if user is moved into care?)

 > How should the system weigh these decisions?
 > When should the user notify the system to take this into account?
 > Who does the user trust to mediate this?


#### When to trust yourself

The user specifies the priorities at the start before they lose full cognitive 
abilities.

User can tell system to modify these priorities during examples like
 > user has a mental breakdown
 > user is drunk
 > user is suicidal
 > user has a really bad day and though not suicidal, is playing fast and free.

How/If the system can determine this is to be looked into.
 
User needs to think about these scenarios BEFORE they happen so in advance can give
their *preferred* line of action or recommendations.
