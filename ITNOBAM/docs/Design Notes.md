
## Design Notes for ITNOBAM


### Finding the standard baseline

Setup will need to map the living area of high care patients but normal
standard operations should be automatically configured and learn what is
normal over time.


### Work out what should and shouldn't be done

Probably via initial setup interviews, with default suggestions

- dont leave stove unattended for more than xx minutes

- if user laying on floor trigger warning

- if user falls, alert backup carer


The interview stage must appear friendly and non intrusive ie clarification if actions rather than straight out "whats your fav colors"
