## System Options

How could this work?

### Hardware

What hardware options are available.

#### Phone

Use the phones camera, GPS and sensors to monitor activity

Pros: convenient to use, accurate sensors, excellent GPS tracking

Cons: unknown system software (could use rooted Android)

#### Raspberry PI (Self contained OS computer)

Pros: auditable, customisable

Cons: Difficult for non technical users to use, and more difficult to audit. GPS expensive, though not needed at a home installed location.


#### PC

Use the PC's usage logging and webcam to log information

Pros: convenient and customisable. Networked

Cons: Hackable. Conflicts with other software.


### Software

Not sure how this will work, long term but it is going to take a lot of iterations.

The idea is that whatever system is setup, you need it to run without fucking around
with settings, payments, changing IP addresses or even needing to restart your system.

It absolutely HAS to run for years - the point of this software is to watch you and 
help you while you lose cognative abilities. You will have to trust this software, and 
it needs to be designed with this in mind.


#### Cloud

Very likely to be a lousy option - what may seem like a great, cheap provider 
today could easily vanish in 10 years. Remember 10 years is a long time in computing and 
this type of software needs to be able to be run without interference until you die.


#### Distributed Local (Internet of Things)

Self contained devices around the house run independantly, doing the job and 'vote' on 
the best result.


#### Single software application

Have one application running that does all the work.

Will start off with this for prototyping


### Embedded Software

Non updatable C code on an embedded computer.
