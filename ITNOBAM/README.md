#### Personal AI Helper that helps you if you have memory loss


### What will it do?

Help people with cognitive issues


The goal of the AI agent is to help you by tracking your actions, movements, PC usage, verbal intent
and find odd patterns and assist / recommend actions if you are doing things outside of normal patterns
(e.g. putting a book on the stovetop)
or through prespecified 'dont do this' events.



### How will it do this

Not sure - but some starting points are below

- data collection and monitoring of actions
- user will need to get used to the system BEFORE losing cognitive control in order to 'trust' it
